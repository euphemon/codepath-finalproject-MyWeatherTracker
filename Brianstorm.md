**App Brainstorming Ideas**
1. Baking Recipe App
- shows different baking recipes in table views using an API and should also have a detailed view for each recipe that the user clicks on
2. GPS tracking weather App
- allowing location tracker in the weather app so that it can display the weather information at where the user is at. Also add a search option so that the user can search for any specific city if they API provides such data.
3. Pokemon Pokedex App
- using a Pokemon API to display pokemons from all generations. User should be able to filter the result based on pokemon types. 
4. Music App
- a music app that displays the album cover in the home screen. When user clicks on the cover the macthed song is played.


**Evaluating the top two ideas:**
1. Pokemon Pokedex App: this interests me the most as I am a big Pokemon fan
2. GPS tracking weather APP: this is very practical as it allows you to search for specific city as well. I can more weather info such as humidity and wind speed other than just the temperature.


**Final idea:**

The GPS tracking weather App because I decided that I want to make a practical/useful app that can benefits others as well.
